# demographic-data-analyzer
This is a project from https://www.freecodecamp.org/

I understand that this might be a simple task, but I've just begun my journey in learning data analysis. Here, I'm outlining my initial steps.

It turns out that working with data is quite interesting. I am learning to manipulate and interpret data, and I hope to be able to create appropriate visualizations independently.

I believe it is quite easy to understand this code with comments provided in the "demographic_data_analyzer.py" file.
